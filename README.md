## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Finally, go to [home page](http://localhost:3000) to see the implementation of ***[john-ui-lib](https://github.com/jpmadrigal07/john-ui-lib)***.

If you want to see the actual code on the component, got to file *`./components/Home.tsx`*.
